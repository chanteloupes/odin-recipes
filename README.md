TOP Recipe project
This project was to build a website that included different reciepes
I was able to apply all the HTML tags and elements that I have learned like adding in images, ordered and unordered list and links
I was able to google and add some additional code we hadn't learned yet like having a picture also be the link, and aligning certain parts of the image so that it is next to the text 
I saw from others projects there was a back to home and back to top link so I googled and learned how to have that added as well
This project helped me with learning how to use Git more and being mindful of when I am committing. I tried to commit early and often and was clear with my commit messages
