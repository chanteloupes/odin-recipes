    <h1>The Best Banana Bread</h1>
    
    <h3>Moist, Delicious, and Easy!</h3>
    <p>Banana bread is one of the simplest yet delicious breads you can make. Its great on its own but just as amazing with some butter or cream cheese spread across it. If you are a baking beginner its a reciepe you can learn the basics with. Once you perfect it, which will not take long, you can make it your own by adding different ingrediants to it. While chocolate chips are always my go too, I have also made some with peanut butter, strawberries, and even <strong>BACON</strong>--Don't knock it til you try it!</p>
    <p>Don't feel obligated to always do a loaf either! What is so great about this recipe is that if you want to throw the batter into some cup cake tins <strong>GO FOR IT</strong>. The only thing to keep in mind is to cut the baking time down as they will cook faster than the hour it takes in the loaf pan.</p> 
    <p><strong>Have fun and experiment!</strong></p>

    <ul><h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>3-4 overly ripened bananas</li>
    <li>1/3 C melted butter</li>
    <li>3/4 C white sugar</li>
    <li>1 egg (beaten)</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla (pure extract is best)</li>
    <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
    <li>1 1/2 C Flour</li>
    <li>Pinch of salt</li>
    <li>1 C (at least) Chocolate chips</li>
    <li>Handful of Raw sugar</li></ul>

    <ol><h3>Directions</h3>
    <li>Preheat over to 350 degrees and line pan with either parchment paper or shorting to prevent sticking</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, smash the bananas, add sugar and mix until combined</li>
    <li>Add in multed butter,egg, and vanilla and mix until combined</li>
    <li>Add in baking soda and salt and mix slightly</li>
    <li>Add in flour slowly, mix while adding until combined - be sure not to overmix batter (it should not be smooth)</li>
    <li>Add chocolate chips and fold into batter - 1 C is just a general amount but feel free to add more if you are a chocoholic like myself</li>
    <li>Pour batter into pan</li>
    <li>Take raw sugar and pour generous amount into your hand, sprinkle across the top of the batter</li>
    <li>Bake in oven for 60 mins - you will know its done if it bounces back when touching the top</li>
    <li>After its out of oven, wait for it to cool a few mins before removing from pan</li></ol>

    <p><h4>Additional Details:</h4></p>
    <p>If you want to do cup cakes instead of the loaf, cut the baking time down to about 25-30 mins. You can turn them into more of a dessert item as well by topping them with some cream cheese frosting!</p>
    <p>There are also mini loaf pans that are available if you like the classic loaf look but want them smaller! These make fun little baked goods to share with friends.</p>
    <p>You can easily swap out the chocolate chips or add to them with this recipe without having to change the rest of the ingredients. Fruits, nuts, bacon (seriously try it) all make great additions to banana bread</p>
