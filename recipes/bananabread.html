    <h3>Moist, Delicious, and Easy!</h3>
    <p>Banana bread is one of the simplest yet delicious breads you can make. Its great on its own but just as amazing with some butter or cream cheese spread across it. If you are a baking beginner its a reciepe you can learn the basics with. Once you perfect it, which will not take long, you can make it your own by adding different ingrediants to it. While chocolate chips are always my go too, I have also made some with peanut butter, strawberries, and even <strong>BACON</strong>--Don't knock it til you try it!</p>
    <p>Don't feel obligated to always do a loaf either! What is so great about this recipe is that if you want to throw the batter into some cup cake tins <strong>GO FOR IT</strong>. The only thing to keep in mind is to cut the baking time down as they will cook faster than the hour it takes in the loaf pan.</p> 
    <p><strong>Have fun and experiment!</strong></p>
