    <h1>Ooey Gooey Double Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>

    <p>The name says it all! This is your standard cookie recipe jammed packed with 2 kinds of chocolate chips. I like to use Ghirardelli 60% cacao dark chocolate chips and semi-sweet chocolate chips. This is my preference so feel free to experiment with different brands and kinds. My husband likes white chocolate so I will change it up at time and use the dark chocolate and white chocolate.</p>
